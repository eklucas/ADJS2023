## Assignment 2

#  This is a chance to practice writing some of the code we've covered so far. 
#  You can reference our "R Dictionary" here:
#  https://github.com/eklucas/ADJS2023/blob/main/tipsheets/R-dictionary.md

# Write your code below each prompt. Feel free to include any attempts you tried that didn't work; 
# it will give me a sense of how you're thinking about code and help me give better feedback.
# Remember to answer the question! Use a hashtag at the beginning of a line to add comments (like these). 

# 1. Import the tidyverse package



# 2. Import the mlb data file



# 3. Who is the best paid player on your favorite team? 



# 4. How many players are starting pitchers ("SP") ?



# 4. How many players make more than $10M? (Hint: unlike text, numbers don't require double quotes)

# Ask two of your own questions and answer them: 
# Q1:
