For this practice, you'll be working with the dispatch data from the Columbia Police.

The goal of this practice is to give you more experience using various functions in different combinations in order to answer questions of a dataset. 

Load the tidyverse and lubridate libraries
```{r}

```

# Load the dispatch data
If you saved a new csv at the end of class on Wed, Feb 2, use that csv (with the new column called "new_CDT"). If you didn't get that far, load the original csv file and run the mutate code below to add that column in, because you'll need it for the following questions
```{r}
dispatch <- 
```

Mutate code, if necessary: 
```{r}
dispatch <- dispatch %>% mutate(new_CDT = mdy_hms(CallDateTime))
```

# Answer these questions: 

- Which day of the week had the most incidents? 
```{r}

```

- Which month had the most incidents?
  Hint: lubridate has a month() function that extracts the month from a date
```{r}

```

- Which Police Area responded to the most incidents of burglary or larceny?
```{r}

```

- Here is some code that looks for any police dispatches to my street and then looks at the most common incident type (ExtNatureDisplayName): 
```{r}
dispatch %>% filter(grepl("RIPLEY", Address))

dispatch %>% filter(grepl("RIPLEY", Address)) %>%
  count(ExtNatureDisplayName) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

-Using similar code, look for incidents near where you live. What's the most common incident type?
```{r}

```

- How often do incidents where shots are fired result in the creation of a police report?
```{r}

```

- What hour are police most active on the weekends? 
```{r}

```

- Ask your own question and answer it!
- Q:
```{r}

```
